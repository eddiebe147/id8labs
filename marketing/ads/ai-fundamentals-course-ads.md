## Ad 1: LinkedIn (B2B Knowledge Workers)

### Primary Text
I've watched hundreds of professionals use ChatGPT and Claude.

The difference between those who get magic and those who get garbage?

It's not the prompts they copy from Twitter.
It's not the "secret techniques."
It's not even which AI they use.

It's a mental model most people never develop.

I built a free 45-minute course that teaches it:
- Why AI output is diagnostic feedback (not a final answer)
- The 5 levers that actually control output quality
- When to refine vs. redirect vs. start over

No fluff. No signup wall. Just the framework.

### Headline
Stop Guessing. Start Getting Consistent Results from AI.

### Description
Free 45-min course. The mental models that separate frustrated users from people who get results every time.

## Ad 2: Meta/Facebook/Instagram (Broader Audience)

### Primary Text
"Why does AI work perfectly sometimes and completely miss the point other times?"

I asked myself this for months.

Then I figured out the pattern.

It's not random. It's not luck. There's a framework.

I put everything into a free 45-minute course:

The Mental Model Shift - Stop treating AI like Google
The 5 Levers - What actually controls output quality
The Iteration Loop - How to fix bad output fast
The Attention Budget - Why more context often backfires

45 minutes. Zero cost. Changes everything.

### Headline
Why AI Works Sometimes (And Fails Other Times)

### Description
Free course reveals the mental models that make AI conversations actually work. 45 minutes to results.

### CTA Button

### Creative Notes

- Video option: 30-sec talking head explaining the "inconsistency problem"

### Targeting Notes
- Age: 25-55
- Interests: ChatGPT, AI tools, productivity apps, self-improvement, online learning
- Behaviors: Technology early adopters, engaged shoppers

## Ad 3: X/Twitter (Tech-Forward Early Adopters)

### Tweet Option A (Thread Starter)
Most people use AI like a slot machine.

Type something in. Hope for the best. Get frustrated when it misses.

Here's what actually works:

[Thread continues with 4-5 tweets, ends with course link]

### Tweet Option B (Single Tweet - Punchy)
ChatGPT works perfectly... sometimes.

Spent 6 months figuring out why.

Turns out there's a pattern. Built a free 45-min course teaching it.

No email required. No upsell popup.

Just the mental models that make AI actually work:

### Tweet Option C (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
The problem with AI isn't the AI.

It's that nobody taught you how to think about the conversation.

You're not "bad at prompting."
You just never learned the framework.

45 minutes. Free. No signup.
