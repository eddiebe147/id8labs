## LinkedIn Post (The Authority Hook)

```
Most tech products fail before the first line of code is even written.

Why? Because they lack a Strategic Foundation.

After years of building for elite startups, we're "open-sourcing" our internal playbook. We've built a 6-module curriculum to take you from a "vision" to a "scalable enterprise product."

🚀 Module 0 is 100% FREE.
🚀 The full Course is now live for a $99 Founder's Special (Save $98).

Stop guessing. Start engineering.

## Instagram/TikTok Hooks (Video Ideas)

### Hook 1: The Naming Problem
```
"Stop scrolling if you've been scared away by the word 'Code'..."

Claude Code isn't for developers. It's for anyone with files to process.

Here's the 6-step blueprint we use at id8 Labs to turn chaos into structure.

```

### Hook 2: The Free Module
```
"I'm giving away the first module of our $197 Masterclass for free. Here's why."

We want you to experience the mental model shift BEFORE you pay.

Stop asking Claude questions. Start delegating tasks.

Module 0 is completely free. No credit card.

```

### Hook 3: The Demo
```
"Watch me organize 500 files in 2 minutes..."

This used to take me an entire afternoon.

Now Claude does it while I make coffee.

This is Module 0 of our course. It's free.

```

### Hook 4: The Before/After
```
"Before: 'Claude, can you help me write an email?'"
"After: 'Here are 47 voice memos. Turn them into a content calendar. Save to Google Drive.'"

That's the shift. From chatbot to operating system.

We teach this in 6 modules. Module 0 is free.
