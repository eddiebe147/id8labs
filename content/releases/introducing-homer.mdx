# Introducing Homer: What If You Could Talk to a House?

It started with a late-night question.

**"What if you could talk to a house?"**

Not in some abstract, philosophical way — but literally. What if a buyer could ask a property anything? What if an agent could delegate the entire research workflow to something that never sleeps, never forgets, and always tells the truth?

That question became Homer.

## The Journey Here

Homer didn't emerge from a vacuum. It's the culmination of years of building tools that felt like exercises — prototypes searching for their purpose.

**ID8Composer** was the thesis. It taught us how to build knowledge bases that actually work. How to capture context, surface the right information at the right time, and make scattered data feel cohesive.

**MILO** taught us task management from the inside out. How to track what matters without drowning in noise. How to make to-do systems that don't collapse under their own weight.

**DeepStack** taught us pattern recognition under pressure. How to stay grounded when emotions run high. How to build systems that keep people honest with themselves.

We focused on **security and performance** in those earlier tools. Built for edge cases. Hardened against failure. Optimized for scale.

Looking back, it's clear: **those weren't just apps. They were training.**

They were preparing us for this moment — for Homer.

## What Homer Actually Is

**Homer is two things:**

### 1. A Trust-Building Tool (Front End)
In an industry where the biggest purchase of your life needs to be with someone you genuinely trust — and tools they trust — Homer is grounded in truth.

Homer gives it to you straight. Powered by Claude Opus 4.5, it has the emotional intelligence to know how to deliver hard truths that a real estate agent might struggle to say. No games. No hidden agendas. Just honest answers.

Homer does the hard work of being forthcoming, so agents can focus on building genuine relationships.

### 2. An Administrative Engine (Back End)
For agents, Homer is leverage. It handles the grunt work: admin tasks, relationship management, contract management, and lead generation — all wrapped around a **robust knowledge base** tailored to each broker's unique practice.

Homer manages the noise so agents can focus on what actually matters: people.

**The result?** Agents can focus on what they do best: **human connection and relationship building.**

Homer does the work. The agent brings the heart.

## Built with Guard Rails

Real estate is regulated for a reason. Compliance isn't optional. Trust isn't negotiable.

Homer is built with **obvious guard rails and checkpoints** to stay compliant with all state real estate laws. Every action is logged. Every recommendation is traceable. Every decision point has human oversight.

We're not replacing agents. We're **amplifying them.**

---

## Why Now?

Because real estate is one of the last industries untouched by intelligent automation. It's ripe for transformation, but that transformation has to come from people who understand the stakes.

This isn't about disruption for disruption's sake. It's about bringing **honesty, transparency, and leverage** to an industry that desperately needs all three.

Buyers deserve better. Agents deserve better. The transaction itself deserves better.

Homer is how we get there.

## What's Next

Homer is live. We're working with early partners to refine the tool, stress-test the workflows, and prove that this model works at scale.

If you're a broker, agent, or someone who believes real estate can be better — **let's talk.**

Because the question isn't "What if you could talk to a house?" anymore.

The question is: **Why wouldn't you?**
