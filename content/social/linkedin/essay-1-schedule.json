Almost.\n\nThe first 70% happens shockingly fast.\nThe last 30% takes longer than writing the whole thing from scratch.\n\nThis is the 70% Problem.\n\nAnd until you understand it, AI coding tools will make you FEEL productive while actually slowing you down.\n\n(Full essay in comments 👇)\n\n#AI #ClaudeCode #SoftwareDevelopment #BuildInPublic #TechFounders",

They felt faster. They measured slower.\n\n90% of engineering teams now use AI tools.\nOnly 16.3% report significant productivity gains.\n41.4% say AI has \"little or no effect.\"\n\nThese numbers aren't anti-AI propaganda.\n\nThey're a signal that we're using these tools wrong.\n\nThe dopamine hit of instant code generation masks the reality of slower delivery.\n\nWhat's your experience?

Surely the people who need help most would benefit most?\n\nBut the data shows the opposite.\n\nWhy?\n\nExperienced developers use AI to accelerate what they already know. They spot when Claude's suggestion is slightly off. They know which patterns work in production.\n\nBeginners use AI to REPLACE what they should be learning. They accept suggestions they don't understand. When the 70% breaks, they can't fix it.\n\nThe cruel irony: the people who need AI most are the people it helps least.\n\nThis is why \"learn to code with AI\" courses often backfire.\n\nYou need the fundamentals FIRST. Then AI becomes a multiplier instead of a crutch.\n\nAgree or disagree?\n\n#AI #LearnToCode #ClaudeCode #DeveloperLife #TechEducation",
