Today we're launching ID8Composer v1.0, a new category of creative tool that treats AI as a writing partner through timeline-based story development.

## What It Does

ID8Composer fundamentally rethinks how writers and AI collaborate on story development. Instead of treating AI as a text generator, we built a timeline interface that treats story creation as a conversation between creative partners.

### Key Features

- **Timeline-based story structure**: Visualize your narrative arc
- **AI conversation system**: Natural dialogue with your creative partner
- **Version tracking**: Every iteration preserved
- **Export to industry formats**: Final Draft, PDF, and more

## Why It Matters

For 20 years, the screenwriting workflow has been essentially the same: write in a specialized text editor, track versions in separate files, collaborate through email attachments.

AI changes everything—but only if we rethink the entire workflow from first principles.

## What's Next

This is v1.0. We're already working on collaborative features, advanced export options, and integrations with production management tools.
