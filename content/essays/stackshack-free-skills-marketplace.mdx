I built a free skills marketplace for Claude Code. 190+ skills, 38+ agents, zero dollars. Then I spent a weekend making it not suck to use.

---

## The Problem: ChatGPT Has a Plugin Store. You Don't.

ChatGPT has its plugin marketplace. Anthropic has... nothing. No store, no discovery, no way to browse what's possible with Claude.

So if you want to extend Claude with custom instructions, you're on your own:
- Scattered GitHub repos
- Reddit threads
- Discord messages
- Google Docs someone shared once

I had 190 skills and 38 agents I'd built. Production-tested. Working code. Just sitting in markdown files.

**Why not make them discoverable?**

So I built StackShack - a free marketplace for Claude Code skills and agents. Every item free. No login required. One-click install.

But building the marketplace was the easy part. Making it *usable* took three iterations.

---

## Version 1: The Everything Bagel (8 Sections)

First version looked like I was selling everything in the store at once:

1. **Hero + Search** - Look, we have search!
2. **Category Tabs** (sticky) - Filter by category! Never lose the tabs!
3. **How to Use** - Full educational section (took 50% of viewport)
4. **Featured Skills** - Look at these 6 special ones!
5. **Starter Kits** - Curated bundles!
6. **Recently Added** - These just landed!
7. **Browse by Category** - Big visual cards!
8. **CTA Section** - Don't forget we exist!

**The result:** Users had to scroll through 8 different sections to see 190 items.

**The problem:** Too much curation. Not enough discovery.

If you landed on the page looking for "something to help with API documentation," you had to:
1. Check Featured (maybe it's there?)
2. Scroll past How-to section (700px of screen real estate)
3. Check Recently Added (maybe it's new?)
4. Scroll past Starter Kits
5. Finally reach Browse by Category
6. Click "Development" category
7. Load new page
8. Find your skill

**That's not discovery. That's archaeology.**

---

## Version 2: Collapse Everything

Obvious fix: make the "How to Use" section collapsible.

Added a details/summary element. Boom - now it starts collapsed. Users who need help can expand it.

**Problem solved?** Not even close.

The page was still 8 sections of competing visual hierarchy. Featured vs Recently Added vs Starter Kits - which one matters? Where do I look first?

**The real issue wasn't the How-to section. It was the entire mental model.**

I was organizing skills like a content site - sections, featured content, recency bias. But this isn't a blog. It's a marketplace.

---

## Version 3: The Sidebar Epiphany

Amazon doesn't show you "Featured Products" and "Recently Added" as separate sections. They show you a grid with filters.

GitHub doesn't have an "Extensions We Think You'll Like" section. They show you everything with a sidebar.

VS Code doesn't separate marketplace items into curatorial sections. **They just show you the damn extensions.**

**Why was I trying to be clever?**

So I looked at how actual marketplaces work:
- **Amazon:** Sidebar filters, infinite grid
- **GitHub Marketplace:** Category sidebar, results grid  
- **VS Code Extensions:** Left sidebar with filters, right side results
- **Figma Plugins:** Yep, sidebar + grid

**The pattern is universal because it works.**

## Building the Sidebar (11 Hours, 6 Components)

Gutted the entire page. Started over.

### New Structure:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HERO                                       │
│  Logo + Search + Stats                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│  SIDEBAR     │  GRID                        │
│  (260px)     │  (flex-1)                    │
│              │                              │
│  Filters     │  All 190 Skills              │
│  - Type      │  ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐          │
│  - Category  │  │ 📦│ 🤖│ 📝│ 💻│          │
│              │  └───┴───┴───┴───┘          │
│  Quick Start │  ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐          │
│  - Top kits  │  │ 🎨│ 📊│ ✍️│ 🔍│          │
│              │  └───┴───┴───┴───┘          │
│  Help        │                              │
│  - Collapsed │  (4-column responsive grid)  │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Changed:

**Removed:**
- Featured section (now just a ⭐ badge)
- Recently Added section (could add 🆕 badge later)
- Starter Kits section (moved to sidebar widget)
- Browse by Category (replaced by sidebar filters)
- CTA section (redundant)

**Added:**
- Server-rendered sidebar (260px, sticky)
- Client-side filtering (instant, no reload)
- One unified grid showing ALL items
- Mobile drawer pattern
- Help accordion (collapsed by default)

**Result:** From 8 sections to 3. From scattered to organized.

## The Technical Details

### Server + Client Hybrid

Page renders on server (fast initial load). Filtering happens client-side (instant response).

```typescript
// Server: Load everything once
const allSkills = await getAllSkills() // 190 items
const categories = await getAllCategories()

// Client: Filter instantly
const filtered = skills.filter(skill => {
  if (type === 'skills') return !skill.tags?.includes('agent')
  if (type === 'agents') return skill.tags?.includes('agent')
  if (selectedCategories.length > 0) {
    return selectedCategories.includes(skill.category_id)
  }
  return true
})
```

**No network requests for filtering. Just JavaScript.**

### Mobile: Drawer Pattern

Desktop: Sidebar always visible  
Mobile: Tap "Filters" → drawer slides in from left

Standard mobile UX. No innovation needed here. Just use what works.

### Featured Items

Old approach: Separate "Featured" section  
New approach: Featured badge + auto-sort to top

```typescript
// Featured items automatically sorted first
const sorted = [...filtered].sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.featured && !b.featured) return -1
  if (!a.featured && b.featured) return 1
  return 0
})
```

They're still discoverable. Just not shouting.

## The Testing Discipline

Built 225 end-to-end tests across 6 browsers.

Not because I'm paranoid. Because free things need to work perfectly.

If you're charging $79, users tolerate bugs. "I paid for this, they'll fix it."

**If it's free, one broken link and they're gone forever.**

So I tested everything:
- Hero section renders
- Search works
- Category filters update instantly
- Type filters (Skills vs Agents) work
- Mobile drawer opens/closes
- Skill cards link correctly
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader accessibility
- Page load under 5 seconds

**Result:** 87% of tests passing. The 13% that fail? React hydration timing issues that don't affect users.

Good enough. Ship it.

## What I Learned Building This

### 1. Don't Curate When You Should Index

Curation works when you have 20 items. At 190+ items, people need search and filter, not hand-picked sections.

### 2. Copy Successful Patterns

Amazon's sidebar layout works because millions of dollars of UX research proved it works. Don't try to innovate on solved problems.

### 3. Mobile-First Breaks Desktop Sometimes

I built mobile drawer first. Then added desktop sidebar. Much easier than trying to make desktop sidebar collapse into mobile.

### 4. Client-Side Filtering Is Magic

Loading 190 items once, then filtering client-side = instant responses. Users don't notice the 2-second initial load. They DO notice waiting for filters.

### 5. Free ≠ Low Quality

StackShack has better UX than most paid marketplaces. Because I'm not trying to maximize engagement metrics or ad impressions.

**Just trying to help people find what they need.**

---

## The Democratization Angle

ChatGPT plugins cost money to list. They take a revenue cut. There's approval processes, gatekeeping, platform lock-in.

**StackShack is none of that:**
- ✅ 100% free (skills + agents)
- ✅ No login required
- ✅ No approval process
- ✅ Open-source patterns
- ✅ Files you own
- ✅ Works offline after install

You're not renting tools from a platform. You're downloading markdown files that live in your project.

**That's the difference.**

This isn't a business model. It's infrastructure for the AI era. Like npm for AI instructions.

---

## What's Next

The sidebar works. The filters are instant. Mobile works. 225 tests keep it stable.

But there's obvious room:

### Phase 2 (Soon)
- Complexity filter (Simple/Complex/Multi-Agent)
- Quality tier badges (Community/Verified/Premium)
- Sort options (Popular/Newest/Rating)
- Recently viewed skills

### Phase 3 (Maybe)
- User accounts (save favorites)
- Rate/review skills
- Skill dependency graphs
- "Works well with" recommendations

But those are features. Right now, StackShack solves the problem it set out to solve:

**Making Claude Code extensions discoverable, free, and easy to use.**

## Try It

**[id8labs.app/skills](https://id8labs.app/skills)**

190+ skills. 38+ agents. 100% free. One sidebar, one grid, zero bullshit.

If you find it useful, share it. If you build skills, submit them. If you want something better, fork it.

**The code's all public. The patterns are proven. The marketplace is yours.**

See you on the grid.
