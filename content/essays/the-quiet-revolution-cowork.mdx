I'll be honest—when I first read about Cowork, I felt something I haven't felt in a while. Not excitement exactly. Recognition.

You know that feeling when someone finally builds the thing you've been describing poorly for years? That.

## What Cowork Actually Is

Anthropic just released [Cowork](https://www.anthropic.com/news/cowork)—and the simplest way to describe it is: Claude Code for people who don't write code.

But that sells it short.

Cowork is what happens when you take the same agentic architecture that's been turning developers into ten-person teams and hand it to the rest of us. The project managers. The operations leads. The founders drowning in screenshots of receipts and folders named "FINAL_FINAL_v3_USE_THIS."

The setup is almost comically simple: you point Claude at a folder on your computer. That's it. That's the barrier to entry now.

From there, Claude plans and executes. It reads files, creates new ones, organizes, transforms—all while telling you what it's doing instead of waiting for you to hold its hand through every step.

## The Numbers That Should Keep You Up at Night

Anthropic just published [research on how AI is transforming their own work](https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic). The findings are... let me just show you:

- **59% of daily work** now involves Claude (up from 28% just twelve months ago)
- **+50% self-reported productivity gains** (up from +20%)
- **67% increase** in merged pull requests per engineer per day
- **27% of Claude-assisted work** involves tasks that wouldn't have been completed otherwise

That last one hit me. Twenty-seven percent of what's getting done now simply *wasn't happening before*. Not done poorly. Not delegated. Just... never touched. The technical debt. The documentation. The cleanup nobody had time for.

Now there's time.

## What I Found Here Is Not Only a Tool But a Mirror

Here's the thing Anthropic's research revealed that nobody's talking about enough: Claude has become the primary resource for questions that used to go to colleagues.

Think about that for a second.

The quick Slack ping to ask how something works. The "hey, can you look at this?" that used to be the fabric of workplace learning. Increasingly, that's going to Claude instead of to each other.

This creates a paradox they're calling the "paradox of supervision"—as our skills atrophy from disuse, we become less able to supervise the AI that's supposed to be helping us. Like a pilot who only knows how to engage autopilot, we risk becoming incapable of landing the plane when we need to.

Is that terrifying? Maybe.

Is it also exactly what happened when we got calculators, then spreadsheets, then search engines? Also yes.

## What We're Waiting to Try

We're on the waitlist. Haven't touched it yet. But here's what I'm thinking about while we wait—the work piling up at ID8Labs that this might finally unlock:

**The LLC paper trail.** Three years of receipts, contracts, and tax documents scattered across drives and email attachments. Every quarter I tell myself I'll organize it properly. Every quarter I don't. Pointing an agent at that chaos and saying "make sense of this" isn't lazy—it's the only way it happens.

**Research synthesis.** We've got folders of competitive analysis, market research, user interviews—fragments of insight that never coalesce because the overhead of organizing them exceeds the time to gather them. What if the synthesis could happen automatically?

**Project archaeology.** Half-finished prototypes. Abandoned branches. Notes from midnight sessions that seemed brilliant at 2am. There's signal in there, buried under years of noise. An agent that can read files and tell me what they actually contain might surface patterns I forgot I was looking for.

**Content repurposing.** Every essay we write could become ten pieces of distribution content. It doesn't because the transformation takes time. But if Claude can read the source and generate the derivatives...

## The Caution Worth Stating

The warnings are worth repeating even without firsthand experience: this thing is autonomous. It makes decisions. Anthropic's developers explicitly warn about "intermediate prompts or accidental file deletions" and emphasize the need for "clear and unambiguous" instructions.

So here's my rule, written before I even get access:

**Never point an agent at a folder you haven't already backed up. Never give vague instructions to something that can execute.**

---

## What Changes When the Barrier Moves

We're at one of those moments. Not the one where everything changes overnight—those are mostly narrative conveniences. But the one where the threshold moves. Where something that required expertise yesterday requires only intention today.

I don't know yet if Cowork will be good. I know what it represents: the gap between "people who can use agentic AI" and "everyone else" is closing.

The debris might finally clear. What we build in that space is still entirely up to us.

I'll report back when we get access.

— Eddie
