I've been selling myself short.

For the past year, I've been building complete AI agent systems—orchestrated teams of 5, 8, 9 agents that coordinate, hand off work, and learn from your patterns. Systems that run my LLC, ship my software, and manage my creative workflows.

And I was calling them "prompts."

---

## The Problem With Prompts

The AI economy taught everyone that prompts are cheap. PromptBase sells them for $3-7 each. Gumroad bundles go for $29-49. The mental model: prompts are disposable, interchangeable, commodity.

But what I built isn't a prompt. It's a CLAUDE.md framework with 9 coordinated agents, custom slash commands, workflow templates, and integration guides. It's a system that took months to develop through actual production use.

Calling that a "prompt" is like calling a Tesla a "battery."

So I stopped. Today I'm launching the **Agent Kits Shop**—a boutique marketplace for complete AI agent systems.

---

## What We're Launching

Five kits. 35 agents. Each one production-tested, fully documented, and ready to run.

| Kit | Agents | What It Does |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| **TMNT Elite** | 9 | Complete dev team in your terminal. KRANG strategic brain, Leonardo coordination, Donatello architecture, Raphael security, Splinter mentorship. |
| **LLC Ops** | 9 | Back office that actually understands your business. Tax strategy, compliance, bookkeeping, quarterly planning. |
| **Pipeline** | 8 | 11-stage product methodology with decay mechanics. No more half-finished projects. |
| **Foundry** | 5 | The meta-system. Captures patterns across all projects. Every build makes the next one faster. |
| **Factory** | 4 | Multi-AI creative orchestration. Midjourney, Grok, Gemini—one tracked workflow. |

These aren't prompts you copy-paste. They're architectures you plant.

## Seeds That Plant Themselves

Think of Agent Kits as seeds:
- You plant the seed (install the kit)
- It grows into a plant (you start using it daily)
- Eventually it becomes a forest (it knows your patterns, complements your style, compounds with every use)

But here's the part I haven't seen anywhere else: **these seeds plant themselves.**

Each kit includes a setup wizard. You say "run the setup wizard" and Claude becomes the installer:

```
Claude: "What type of project will you primarily use Pipeline for?"
Claude: "How aggressive should the decay mechanics be?"
Claude: "How strict should the checkpoint gates be?"

[You answer through conversation]

Claude: [customizes the system based on your answers]
Claude: [creates files, initializes tracking, verifies installation]

Claude: "✅ Installed. Ready to use."
```

No dashboard. No configuration UI. No manual setup. The agent interviews you and builds itself around your answers.

I researched Salesforce Agentforce, Beam AI, CrewAI, n8n—they're all platforms or frameworks. You rent their system or build from scratch.

Agent Kits are different. Complete systems that configure themselves through conversation. Files you own that become yours through dialogue.

## What's In Each Kit

Every kit ships with:

- **CLAUDE.md** — Agent definitions, behaviors, coordination rules
- **SKILL.md** — Slash commands, workflows, procedures
- **Hooks** — Automation triggers for events
- **Reference docs** — Deep domain knowledge (50-150KB per kit)
- **SETUP-WIZARD.md** — The self-installer
- **RECOVERY/** — Health checks and troubleshooting

Not a prompt. An operating system.

---

## How Delivery Works

Buy a kit → Stripe processes payment → webhook fires → you're added as a GitHub collaborator → clone the repo → run the setup wizard → you're live in 5 minutes.

Fully automated. No manual steps on my end. The shop runs itself.

(I built the entire infrastructure in a weekend with Claude Code. That's the same leverage the kits provide.)

## Pricing

I looked at market rates:
- PromptBase: $3-7 per prompt
- Gumroad bundles: $29-99
- AppSumo lifetime deals: $49-99

Agent Kits are complete systems with multi-agent orchestration, self-installation, and deep domain expertise. I priced them like infrastructure:

| Kit | Price | What It Replaces |
|-----|-------|------------------|
| TMNT Elite | $129 | $15-20k/month in senior developer oversight |
| LLC Ops | $79 | $50k+/year in accountant and bookkeeper fees |
| Pipeline | $79 | The projects you abandoned last year |
| Foundry | $79 | Months of rediscovering solutions you already found |
| Factory | $49 | 10+ hours/week of AI tool management |
| **Bundle** | **$299** | Everything. Save $116. |

Buy once. Install through conversation. Use forever. Watch it grow.

## Try It

**[id8labs.app/products/agent-kits](https://id8labs.app/products/agent-kits)**

Start with LLC Ops or Pipeline at $79 to test the water. Or grab the bundle for $299 and get the full ecosystem.

Either way—you're not buying prompts. You're planting infrastructure.

See you in the forest.
