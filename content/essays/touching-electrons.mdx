## The Problem

I wanted to see my code. Really *see* it.

Not in the abstract way you understand a codebase after months of working in it. I wanted to touch the electrons. To have a constant visual of what files exist, what's changed, what branch I'm on. The kind of spatial awareness that makes you feel grounded in a project.

So I installed Antigravity.

It's a slick tool—gives you a visual file tree, shows your git status, makes the codebase feel tangible. Perfect, right?

Except it kept crashing my machine.

## The Realization

After the third hard restart, I had that moment every builder eventually has: *What am I actually using here?*

I thought about it. Really thought about it.

- **File tree**: I want to see what exists
- **Git status**: I want to know what branch I'm on and what's changed

That's it. Two features. Two.

I was running a heavy Electron app that was melting my laptop... for two features.

## The Discovery

When I told Claude what I wanted, I was ready to build something. Maybe a custom iTerm2 plugin? A lightweight Antigravity alternative? Something new.

Instead, Claude asked a question that stopped me:

> "Why not try tmux?"

Tmux. I'd never heard of it.

"Terminal multiplexer," Claude explained. A tool that's been around for decades. Lets you split your terminal into panes, run persistent sessions, customize everything.

My first reaction: *Why don't I know about this?*

My second reaction: *Let's dive in.*

## The Build

Learning tmux felt like learning a new language—except the vocabulary is small and the payoff is immediate.

The basics took maybe ten minutes:
- `Ctrl+a` is your "prefix" key (like saying "hey tmux, listen up")
- `|` splits the screen vertically
- `-` splits horizontally
- Arrow keys move between panes

That's it. That's enough to start.

But we didn't stop there. Within an hour, we'd built something beautiful:

**A custom tmux configuration with:**
- "Amber Ember" theme (because aesthetics matter)
- A dev layout triggered by `prefix + D` that creates:
  - Top-left: live file tree
  - Bottom-left: live git status
  - Right: my main workspace
- Session persistence (it survives restarts!)
- Vim-style navigation (because old habits die hard)

**A launch script that fires up:**
- `lf` (a terminal file manager) for browsing
- `lazygit` for git operations
- `claude` for... well, you know

One command: `dev-session.sh`

And I have exactly what I wanted. File visibility. Branch awareness. No crashes.

## The Lesson

There are tools that have been solving problems for decades. Battle-tested. Reliable. Free. And I didn't know they existed.

I was ready to *build* something. To write code. To create a new thing that solved my problem. That's my instinct as a builder—when something doesn't work, make something better.

But the better move was to *discover*. To ask: "Has anyone solved this before?"

The answer is almost always yes.

I traded a fancy Electron app for a 30-year-old terminal multiplexer. No crashes. Faster startup. More control. And I learned something new.

Sometimes the answer isn't to build something new. Sometimes it's to discover what already exists—and make it yours.

## Get the Setup

If you want this workflow, I've packaged everything in StackShack:

```
┌─────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐
│   lf (files)    │                                   │
│                 │                                   │
├─────────────────┤         claude / editor           │
│                 │                                   │
│  lazygit (git)  │                                   │
│                 │                                   │
└─────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[Download the tmux config →](https://github.com/id8labs/id8labs/tree/main/content/stackshack/tmux)**

**Quick start:**
```bash
brew install tmux lf lazygit
# Then copy tmux.conf to ~/.tmux.conf
# Run dev-session.sh to launch
```

**The magic shortcut:** `Ctrl+a` then `D` = instant dev layout

**Why it works:**
- Zero startup time
- Never crashes
- Survives terminal closes
- Looks good

## Final Thought

Antigravity was trying to do too much. My tmux setup does exactly two things well. And that's the difference between a tool that fights you and a tool that fades into the background.

The goal was never to have a cool tool. The goal was to *feel connected to the code*.

Mission accomplished.
