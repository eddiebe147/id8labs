I noticed it last week at 2am.

My left hand was positioned exactly where it's been for fifteen years of StarCraft - thumb on Command, fingers resting on 1 through 4. Except I wasn't warping in Zealots or microing Marines. I was cycling through four Claude Code terminal sessions, each agent working a different part of the same build.

Command-1. Check the frontend agent's progress.
Command-2. Backend agent needs a decision.
Command-3. Testing agent found something.
Command-4. Documentation agent is waiting on context.

Same keystrokes. Same rapid assessment. Same mental model. Same planning loop running underneath it all.

**The muscle memory isn't a coincidence - it's vertical integration.**

## Control Groups Are Just Agent Management

In StarCraft, you bind units to control groups because you can't watch everything at once. You learn to trust that your group-3 units are doing what you told them while you focus on group-1.

Multi-agent workflows work identically. You spin up specialized agents, give them clear objectives, and cycle through to check progress and provide direction. The cognitive load is the same. The switching cost is the same. The skill is knowing *when* to check each group and *what* to look for when you do.

Fifteen years of RTS trained me to:

- Hold multiple parallel processes in working memory
- Make fast assessments with incomplete information
- Know when to micro-manage vs. trust the macro
- Recognize when something's going wrong by *feel* before I see the evidence

## Macro vs. Micro Translates Directly

StarCraft players talk about "macro" (economy, production, expansion) versus "micro" (individual unit control in battles).

In multi-agent work, macro is project architecture, context management, which agents need what information, sequencing. Micro is diving into a specific agent's output, refining a prompt, debugging a particular interaction.

The players who win aren't the ones with the best micro. They're the ones who never let their macro slip while they're microing.

Same principle. If you're so deep in one agent's output that you forget to feed context to the others, your build falls apart. The economy has to keep running.

## The Planning Loop You Already Know

Here's the rhythm that StarCraft burns into your nervous system:

**Scout → Plan → Execute → Verify → Adjust**

You send a probe into their base. You read what they're building. You decide your response. You execute the build. You check if it's working. You re-scout. You adjust. Loop.

Thousands of games. Thousands of repetitions. The loop becomes automatic.

Now watch what happens in a multi-agent workflow:

**Assess → Plan → Execute → Verify → Adjust**

You check the current state across your agents. You decide what needs to happen next and in what order. You dispatch the work. You cycle through outputs and check against intention. You course correct. Loop.

It's the same loop. The one military strategists call OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act). The one competitive players internalize without ever naming it.

StarCraft didn't teach me this loop intellectually. It *installed* it through repetition until it became the default way I process parallel workstreams. That installation is paying dividends now.

## Why I Still Play Zerg

In StarCraft, your faction choice says something about how your brain wants to solve problems.

**Protoss** players build fewer, more powerful units. Each one matters. You micro carefully, position precisely, and make every investment count. Lose a key unit and you feel it.

**Terran** players fortify. They're positional, defensive, methodical. They build walls, siege up, and control space. Grind it out.

**Zerg** players swarm. You build fast, expand aggressively, and overwhelm with volume. Individual units are cheap and expendable. The power is in the collective, the pressure from all angles at once. You accept inefficiency in exchange for speed and coverage.

I've always been Zerg. Zergling floods. Overwhelm the problem. Sacrifice units freely because more are already spawning.

That's exactly how I run multi-agent workflows.

I don't spin up one carefully-crafted agent and nurse it through a task. I spawn multiple lightweight agents, point them at the problem from different angles, and let them swarm it. Some runs are inefficient. Some outputs get thrown away. Doesn't matter - the velocity and coverage more than compensate.

But here's the thing about Zerg that people misunderstand: **the swarm isn't chaos. It's coordinated.**

Fifty zerglings don't each have their own plan. They execute *one* plan in parallel. The power comes from unified intention distributed across many bodies.

That's how I work with agents. I don't spin up a bunch of autonomous agents and let them wander. I develop the plan first - clear objectives, defined scope, understood constraints. Then I swarm it with agents, all running that same plan from different angles. One plan, many executors. The agents aren't thinking strategically; I am. They're executing in parallel what would take me forever to do sequentially.

**The swarm is the amplifier. The plan is the signal.**

This isn't the "right" way. It's *my* way. And I only recognize it now because StarCraft showed me my own pattern thousands of times before I had words for it.

**What's your faction?**

If you've never played StarCraft, maybe you should. Not for the APM or the ladder rank - but because 20 hours in, you'll know something about yourself. You'll discover whether you're the type to build walls or flood the map. Whether you micro three units perfectly or spawn thirty and let them rip.

That self-knowledge transfers. Your agentic workflow style is probably already inside you, waiting for the right interface to reveal it.

## The Fog of War Is Permanent Now

Here's what RTS actually prepares you for that nothing else does: **operating decisively with incomplete information.**

You never see the whole map in StarCraft. You scout, you infer, you make decisions, you adjust when you're wrong. Waiting for perfect information means you've already lost.

AI agents don't give you perfect information either. You're reading outputs, inferring state, making judgment calls about when to intervene and when to let it run. The comfort with ambiguity - that's the real transfer.

## Why I'm Up at 3am Again

I genuinely thought I'd aged out of that intensity. Turns out I was wrong about what caused it.

It wasn't youth. It was **stimulation matching cognition.**

StarCraft kept me up because it demanded exactly the kind of rapid parallel processing my brain apparently craves. For years, nothing else hit that frequency. Work was too slow, too linear, too single-threaded.

Multi-agent workflows plug directly into that same circuit. The same neurons are firing. The same flow state emerges. I'm not fighting my attention - I'm riding it.

If you spent your teens and twenties in RTS games and thought those hours were "wasted," I have good news: you were training for something that didn't exist yet.

## The Tactical Insight

For the builders reading this who have StarCraft hours (or any RTS hours) banked:

1. **Set up your environment for control-group switching.** Terminal tabs, tmux panes, whatever - make Command+1-4 (or your equivalent) actually *do* something useful.
2. **Think in build orders.** Which agent needs to be established before the next one can be effective? Sequencing matters.
3. **Run the loop consciously at first.** Assess → Plan → Execute → Verify → Adjust. It'll become automatic again fast.
4. **Trust your macro instincts.** If something feels off about the overall project even though each individual agent output looks fine, trust that. You've trained that sense.
5. **Don't over-micro.** The urge to constantly check every agent is the same urge that makes bad StarCraft players lose their economy. Set direction, cycle through, intervene only when needed.

You already have the skills. The interface just finally caught up.
