I had 12 projects in various states of decay. Markdown files everywhere. No visibility into what needed attention. So I built a terminal dashboard that makes the invisible visible—decay bars, sparklines, health indicators, all updating live.

I had 12 projects in various states of decay. Some were thriving. Some were dying. Most were somewhere in between, and I had no idea which was which.

The data existed—markdown files with YAML frontmatter tracking state, activity, blockers. But opening files one by one? That's not visibility. That's archaeology.

I needed a dashboard. Not a web app. A terminal tool I could run from anywhere, glance at in two seconds, and know exactly what needed attention.

So I built Pipeline CLI.

## The Problem with Project Tracking

Most project management tools optimize for the wrong things:

- **Spreadsheets** give you data but no insight
- **Kanban boards** show movement but not momentum
- **To-do apps** track tasks but miss the bigger picture

What I needed was something that treated my project portfolio like a living system—one where projects decay without attention, where some stages move faster than others, and where the visual display tells me what matters before I ask.

## What Pipeline CLI Does

Run `id8` from anywhere. Get this:

One glance. Full picture. No clicking through tabs.

## The Core Concepts

### Decay Mechanics

Every project decays. Not because it's dying—because attention is finite.

Different stages have different decay windows:
- **CAPTURED** (raw ideas): 14 days before they rot
- **VALIDATING**: 7 days to prove or kill
- **BUILDING**: 90 days of active development
- **OPERATING**: 365 days of runway

The decay bar shows you where each project stands. Green means healthy. Yellow means pay attention. Red means act now or accept the loss.

### Health Indicators

Visual at a glance:
- 🟢 Healthy: 0-50% decay
- 🟡 Warning: 50-85% decay
- 🔴 Critical: 85-100% decay
- ❄️ Ice: Frozen (intentionally paused)

### Sparklines

Activity over time, compressed into a single line: `▁▂▄▆█▇▅`

You can see momentum at a glance. Rising activity? Project's alive. Flatline? Something's wrong.

## The Technical Stack

**Python + Rich**. That's it.

Rich handles the terminal UI—tables, panels, colors, live updating. It's the library that makes terminal apps look like they belong in a control room.

**Click** for the CLI framework. Clean command structure, help text, argument parsing.

**Pydantic** for data models. Type-safe, validated, with sensible defaults.

**python-frontmatter** for parsing the markdown files where project data lives.

The whole thing is ~1500 lines of Python. Installs globally with `pip install id8-cli`. Works on any terminal.

---

## The Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `id8` | Live dashboard (default) |
| `id8 pulse` | Quick 2-minute check |
| `id8 list` | Simple table view |
| `id8 show <slug>` | Deep dive on one project |
| `id8 new <slug> <name>` | Create project |
| `id8 log <slug> <note>` | Log activity |
| `id8 update <slug> <STATE>` | Transition state |
| `id8 ice <slug>` | Freeze project |
| `id8 thaw <slug>` | Unfreeze project |
| `id8 kill <slug>` | Kill project |

The live dashboard updates every 5 seconds. Press 'q' to quit. That's the interface.

## Why Terminal?

Three reasons:

**1. Speed.** No browser tabs. No loading spinners. Run `id8`, see everything, move on.

**2. Availability.** Works over SSH. Works in tmux. Works while you're debugging something else. The dashboard is always one command away.

**3. Focus.** Terminals don't have notifications, sidebars, or suggested content. You look at your projects. That's it.

Web dashboards are great for collaboration. But this is a solo builder's tool. Different constraints.

---

## What I Learned Building It

**Build for the actual problem.** I didn't need project management. I needed visibility. The dashboard is read-heavy, write-light. That's intentional.

**Decay mechanics change behavior.** When you see a project at 85% decay, you make a decision. Work on it or kill it. The visual pressure prevents the slow death of neglect.

**Sparklines are magic.** Seven characters can show you a week of momentum. More information-dense than any chart.

**Rich is incredible.** Seriously. If you're building anything terminal-based, start there.

---

## The Data Model

Projects live in `~/.id8labs/projects/` as markdown files:

```yaml
---
slug: composer
name: ID8 Composer
state: BUILDING
created: 2024-09-15
last_activity: 2025-12-20
---

# One-liner
AI-assisted writing with selective knowledge base management.

# Blockers
- None

# Activity Log
- 2025-12-20: Shipped v0.8.1
- 2025-12-19: Fixed auth bug
```

Simple. Portable. Version-controllable. No database required.

---

## What's Next

The current version works. But there's obvious room:

- **Git integration**: Auto-log commits as activity
- **Notifications**: Alert when projects hit critical decay
- **Team mode**: Aggregate multiple portfolios
- **API**: Pipe data into other tools

But those are features. Right now, Pipeline CLI is a tool that solves a specific problem I have today.

---

## Build Something Like This?

Here's the thing: every workflow has invisible friction. Stuff you click through. Tabs you switch between. Mental overhead you've normalized.

Pipeline CLI exists because I was tired of not knowing what needed attention across a dozen projects. The solution is a visual dashboard with decay mechanics and live updating.

Your problem is different. Your solution will be too.

**But the pattern is the same: take something invisible and make it visible. Take something scattered and centralize it. Take something manual and automate it.**

CLI dashboards. AI orchestration. Production tools. Browser automation. If you've got a workflow that's held together by duct tape and browser tabs, I can probably build something better.
