I've been running what I call my "Automation Empire" for months—23 scheduled launchd jobs that detect signals across my development environment. Dependency vulnerabilities, marketing streaks, context switches, 70% complete projects gathering dust. Each automation runs on a schedule, generates a report, and waits for me to notice.

Then I saw Bhanu Teja P's article about "Mission Control"—10 AI agents coordinated through a shared database, each with specialized skills, communicating through @mentions and heartbeats. His agents didn't just detect signals; they acted on them.

Same problem. Different solutions. Both incomplete alone.

My automations were reliable signal detectors but dumb dispatchers—they'd find problems but couldn't route them intelligently. Bhanu's agents were smart coordinators but needed external signals to know what to work on.

The hybrid was obvious: **signal detection + intelligent routing + specialized agents**.

I call it HYDRA: Hybrid Unified Dispatch and Response Architecture.

**Strengths:**
- Rock-solid reliability (launchd never forgets)
- Comprehensive signal coverage
- Zero ongoing cost (shell scripts)
- Easy to debug (just logs)

**Weaknesses:**
- Single agent bottleneck (MILO does everything)
- No intelligent routing
- Reports pile up unread
- No inter-agent communication

**The key insight:** Signal detection is cheap (shell scripts). Coordination is cheap (SQLite). Only the *thinking* needs to be expensive—and even then, only the coordinator.

## Cost Optimization: The \$10/day Coordinator

HYDRA's solution: **Tiered models**.

| Agent | Role | Model | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| MILO | Coordinator | Claude Sonnet 4 | ~\$10/day |
| FORGE | Dev Specialist | DeepSeek V3.2 | FREE |
| SCOUT | Research | Qwen3 235B | FREE |
| PULSE | Ops | Llama 4 Maverick | FREE |

**Total cost: ~\$300/month** instead of ~\$1,200/month (four premium agents).

---

## The @Mention System

\`\`\`bash
hydra route "Hey @forge can you fix the auth bug? @pulse check deploy logs. Urgent!"
\`\`\`

This creates tasks and notifications routed to the right agents automatically.

---

## What I Learned

1. **Signals and Coordination Are Different Problems** - Let cheap systems handle detection, intelligent systems handle coordination.
2. **Not Every Agent Needs Premium Intelligence** - Tier models by task complexity.
3. **SQLite is Enough** - No need for hosted databases when agents poll on heartbeats.
4. **@Mentions Are Better Than Queues** - Language models understand language.
5. **The Daily Standup Is Non-Negotiable** - Build forcing functions into your systems.

## What's Built

HYDRA v1.0 is complete with 6 phases:

1. Foundation - SQLite coordination database
2. Agent Workspaces - MILO, FORGE, SCOUT, PULSE
3. Task Routing - CLI and @mention system
4. Daily Standups - Automated morning reports
5. Documentation - Complete setup guides
6. Telegram Integration - Standup delivery to phone

**HYDRA doesn't think for me. It thinks *with* me.**

*Built with Claude Code. Inspired by Bhanu Teja P's Mission Control pattern.*
