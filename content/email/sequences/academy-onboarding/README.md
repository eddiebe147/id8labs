Hey,

Welcome to ID8 Academy.

You just made a decision most people avoid — investing in how you think, not just what you do.

**Here's what happens next:**

→ **Your Academy Dashboard**
Everything lives here. Modules, resources, your progress.

→ **Start with Module 1: The Innovation Mindset**
Takes about 20 minutes. Do it today while momentum is fresh.

## Email 2: Your First 48 Hours

**Send**: Day 1 (+24 hours)
**Subject**: The one thing that separates finishers from browsers
**Alt Subjects**:
- Don't be part of the 67%
- Your first 48 hours matter

### Content

Hey,

Quick truth: **67% of online course buyers never finish.**

You're not going to be one of them. Here's why:

The Academy is built different. Each module is under 30 minutes. No 4-hour lectures. No endless theory.

**Your move today:**
□ Complete Module 1 if you haven't
□ Start Module 2: Problem Framing

That's it. Two modules. Under an hour total.

The people who finish aren't smarter — they just **move faster at the start**.

**MILO** is the AI tool we built to help you actually use what you're learning.

**Here's what MILO does:**
- Breaks down your projects into actionable steps

## Email 4: Progress Check

**Send**: Day 7 (+168 hours)
**Subject**: Week one — where are you?
**Alt Subjects**:
- Quick check-in
- Module 3 is where it clicks

### Content

Hey,

It's been a week. Quick check-in.

**If you're ahead:** Nice. Keep moving. The best modules are still coming.

**If you're behind:** That's fine. Life happens.

But here's the thing — **Module 3 (Rapid Prototyping)** is where most students have their first "aha" moment.

Don't let it sit.

[Pick Up Where You Left Off →]

One module today. That's the only ask.

## Email 5: The Halfway Point

**Send**: Day 14 (+336 hours)
**Subject**: You're halfway. Here's what changes now.
**Alt Subjects**:
- The second half is different
- From theory to revenue

### Content

Hey,

If you've been following along, you're about halfway through the Academy.

Here's what I want you to notice:

> **The first half** was about SEEING differently.
> **The second half** is about BUILDING differently.

Modules 4-6 get tactical. You'll walk away with:
- A validation framework you can use tomorrow
- A launch checklist that removes guesswork
- The ID8 feedback loop that compounds results

This is where theory becomes revenue.

Almost there,
Eddie
