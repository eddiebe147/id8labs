## THE BIG IDEA

### "Is this a good idea?"

This is the question that kills most innovation before it starts.

It's the wrong question. Here's why:

"Good" is subjective. It invites opinion. It triggers debate. And debate is where momentum goes to die.

The better question: **"What would have to be true for this to work?"**

This shifts the conversation from judgment to discovery. Instead of defending an idea, you're mapping its conditions.

Try it in your next meeting. Watch what happens.

## FRAMEWORK: The Assumption Stack

Before you build anything, list your assumptions in order of risk.

**Level 1: Market assumptions**
→ "People have this problem"

**Level 2: Solution assumptions**
→ "This approach solves it"

**Level 3: Business assumptions**
→ "They'll pay for it"

Validate Level 1 before touching Level 2.
Most failed products skip straight to Level 3.

## CASE STUDY: The $40K Mistake We Didn't Make

Last quarter, we almost built a feature nobody asked for.

**The assumption:** "Users want AI-generated reports."

**The reality:** They wanted fewer reports, not more.

We caught it by running 5 customer calls before writing a single line of code.

**Cost:** $0 and 3 hours.
**Savings:** ~$40K in dev time.

**The lesson:** Assumptions are free to list. Expensive to ignore.

## [ACADEMY EXCLUSIVE] MILO TIP: The Pre-Mortem Prompt

Open MILO and try this:

This surfaces blind spots you didn't know you had.

## CLOSING

That's Issue #1.

The Assumption Stack alone has saved us countless hours of wasted work. Try it on your next idea.

See you next month,
