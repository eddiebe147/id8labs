## Introduction

Welcome back. You've mastered file processing in Module 2. You can organize invoices, extract data from documents, and search your files by meaning. Claude is saving you hours on tedious work.

Now we're entering different territory. This module is about writing — and it requires a mindset shift.

When Claude processes files, you're delegating mechanical work. When Claude helps you write, you're entering a collaboration. The goal isn't to have Claude write FOR you. It's to write WITH Claude — using AI to accelerate your thinking, not replace it.

This is where most people go wrong with AI writing. They hand over the whole task and get generic slop. Or they refuse to use it at all because "it doesn't sound like me." Both miss the point.

The delegation formula still applies: Context + Outcome + Location. But with writing, context means your voice, your ideas, your half-formed thoughts. Claude's job is to help you shape them, not generate them from scratch.

## The Writing Partnership Model

Think about how you'd work with a great editor or writing assistant. You wouldn't say "write me a blog post about productivity." You'd have a conversation. You'd share your rough ideas. They'd push back, ask questions, help you find clarity.

That's how to use Claude for writing.

### What Claude Does Well

- **Expanding rough notes into full drafts** — You provide the skeleton, Claude adds flesh
- **Editing for clarity and flow** — Cutting the fluff, tightening sentences, fixing structure
- **Matching your existing voice** — When given examples, Claude can write in your style
- **Brainstorming and ideation** — Generating options you can react to
- **Overcoming blank page syndrome** — Getting something on the page to work with

### What Claude Does Poorly

- **Original insights** — Claude recombines existing ideas; breakthrough thinking is yours
- **Personal stories** — Only you know what happened and how it felt
- **Your unique perspective** — Claude can mimic style, but your worldview is yours
- **Emotional authenticity** — If it needs to feel personal, it needs to BE personal

Eddie's philosophy:

> "I use Claude like I used to use voice notes to myself. I ramble my ideas, then ask Claude to organize them. The thinking is mine. The structure comes from the collaboration. That's the sweet spot."

## From Voice Notes to Drafts

This is one of the highest-leverage writing workflows: turning your spoken thoughts into written drafts.

### The Voice Note Workflow

**Step 1: Record yourself rambling**

Use Voice Memos on your phone, or any recording app. Don't try to be articulate. Just talk through your idea as if explaining it to a friend.

- What's the main point?
- Why does it matter?
- What are 2-3 supporting examples?
- What's the takeaway?

Five minutes of rambling usually contains a solid draft.

**Step 2: Get it transcribed**

Use your phone's transcription, or a service like Otter.ai, or even Claude itself if you save the audio file.

**Step 3: Delegate the transformation**

**The delegation:**
> "Here's a rough voice transcription of my thoughts on [topic]. Turn this into a clear, structured [blog post/email/memo]. Keep my voice and examples. Organize my rambling into logical sections. The audience is [who]. Target length: [word count]. Save to ~/Documents/Drafts/[filename].md"

**What happens:** Claude takes your authentic thinking and gives it shape. Your ideas, your examples, your voice — but organized and readable.

Eddie's real example:

> "I was stuck on this course's Module 0 script. Spent an hour staring at the blank page. Finally, I just opened Voice Memos and talked for 8 minutes about what I wanted people to understand. Rambling, tangents, half-sentences.
>
> Transcribed it. Told Claude: 'Turn this into a video script. Keep my conversational tone. Target 5 minutes spoken. Make it flow.'
>
> First draft in 90 seconds. I edited for 20 minutes. Done. The whole thing took less time than staring at the blank page."

## Editing Workflows

Sometimes you've already written something, but it needs work. Claude excels at different types of editing passes.

### The Clarity Pass

**The delegation:**
> "Read this draft. Edit for clarity: simplify complex sentences, cut unnecessary words, make the structure more logical. Preserve my voice and main points. Show me what you changed and why."

**What happens:** Claude tightens your writing without changing what you're saying.

### The Audience Shift

**The delegation:**
> "Here's a technical explanation I wrote for developers. Rewrite it for business executives who don't code. Same information, different framing. Keep it under 500 words."

**What happens:** Claude translates your expertise into language your audience understands.

### The Tone Adjustment

**The delegation:**
> "This email sounds too formal/casual. Adjust the tone to be more [conversational/professional/direct/warm]. Keep the same message."

**What happens:** Claude recalibrates without rewriting from scratch.

### The Structure Fix

**The delegation:**
> "This document rambles. Reorganize it into clear sections with headers. Put the most important information first. Cut any repetition."

**What happens:** Claude fixes the architecture while keeping your words.

Eddie's editing tip:

> "I don't ask Claude to 'make it better.' That's too vague. I tell it exactly what's wrong: 'The opening is too long.' 'This paragraph is confusing.' 'The ending trails off.' Specific problems get specific solutions."

## Finding Your Voice (With Claude's Help)

Here's the fear: "If I use AI, my writing won't sound like me."

Here's the reality: Claude can learn your voice — if you teach it.

### The Voice Training Approach

**Step 1: Gather your best writing**

Find 3-5 pieces you've written that sound like YOU. Emails you're proud of. Blog posts that got good feedback. Anything where you think "that's my voice."

**Step 2: Feed Claude your voice**

**The delegation:**
> "Read these 4 samples of my writing. Analyze my writing style: sentence length, vocabulary, tone, how I structure arguments, my typical openings and closings, any verbal tics or patterns. Create a 'voice profile' for me. Save it to ~/Documents/my-writing-voice.md"

**What happens:** Claude creates a reference document describing how you write.

**Step 3: Use the profile**

**For future writing:**
> "Read my voice profile at ~/Documents/my-writing-voice.md. Then help me write [whatever] in my natural voice."

**What happens:** Claude matches your patterns instead of defaulting to generic AI voice.

Eddie's experience:

> "I write casually. Short sentences. Lots of 'you' and 'I.' Sentence fragments. Questions to the reader. When I first used Claude, it gave me this polished, formal prose that sounded nothing like me. I was about to give up.
>
> Then I fed it 5 of my essays. Now it nails my voice. It still needs editing — the rhythm isn't always right — but it's 80% there. That last 20% is my job anyway."

## The First Draft Machine

Blank page syndrome is real. Sometimes the hardest part is just getting words on the page. Claude is excellent at breaking this block.

### The Brainstorm Burst

When you don't know what to write:

**The delegation:**
> "I need to write about [topic] for [audience]. Give me 10 possible angles or hooks I could take. Mix conventional and unexpected approaches."

**What happens:** Claude gives you options to react to. Even if you hate all 10, you'll know more about what you actually want to say.

### The Outline Sprint

When you know the topic but not the structure:

**The delegation:**
> "Here's what I want to cover in this [article/email/report]: [your bullet points]. Create 3 different outlines I could use. One should be conventional, one should be surprising, one should be very short."

**What happens:** You see structural options before committing to one.

### The Ugly First Draft

When you just need something to exist:

**The delegation:**
> "Write a rough first draft about [topic]. Don't try to be polished. Just get the main ideas on the page in a logical order. I'll rewrite heavily, so focus on completeness over quality."

**What happens:** You have raw material to sculpt instead of a blank page to fear.

Eddie's blank page cure:

> "My rule: never stare at a blank page for more than 5 minutes. If nothing comes, I either talk into Voice Memos or ask Claude for an ugly first draft. Something on the page beats nothing on the page. Always. You can fix bad writing. You can't fix no writing."

## Email Workflows

Email is where most knowledge workers spend their writing time. Claude can dramatically speed up the tedious parts.

### The Reply Assist

**The delegation:**
> "Here's an email I received: [paste email]. Draft a reply that: [your key points]. Tone should be [professional/friendly/firm]. Keep it under [X] sentences."

**What happens:** Claude handles the structure; you review and personalize.

### The Difficult Email

When you're procrastinating because the email is awkward:

**The delegation:**
> "I need to email [person/role] about [situation]. This is uncomfortable because [why]. Help me write something that is [direct but kind/firm but fair/apologetic but not groveling]. The key message is [what]."

**What happens:** Claude provides a starting point for the email you've been avoiding.

### The Batch Processing

**The delegation:**
> "Here are 5 emails I need to respond to: [paste all]. For each one, draft a brief reply. Consistent professional tone. I'll review and send."

**What happens:** 30 minutes of email becomes 5 minutes of review.

Eddie's email confession:

> "I used to spend 20 minutes on emails that didn't deserve 20 minutes. Now I tell Claude: 'Reply to this. Be brief. Be professional. Three sentences max.' Then I read it, tweak one word, and send. Same result, 18 minutes saved."

## Report and Document Generation

For longer documents — reports, proposals, documentation — Claude can do the heavy lifting if you provide the right inputs.

### The Data-to-Report Workflow

**The delegation:**
> "Here's the raw data from [source]: [paste or point to file]. Create a report that includes: executive summary (2 paragraphs), key findings (bullet points), detailed analysis by [category], and recommendations. Format professionally. Save to ~/Documents/Reports/[filename].md"

**What happens:** Claude transforms raw data into polished deliverables.

### The Template Application

**The delegation:**
> "Here's my proposal template: [paste structure]. Here's the information for this specific proposal: [details]. Fill in the template for [client/project]. Match the tone of my previous proposals."

**What happens:** Claude handles the repetitive customization while you focus on strategy.

### The Summary Stack

**The delegation:**
> "Read these 5 documents: [list files]. Create a single summary document that synthesizes the key points across all of them. Note any contradictions or gaps. Format with clear sections."

**What happens:** Claude does the synthesis work you'd spend hours on.

## Your Challenge: The Voice Note Draft

This week, create one piece of writing using the voice-to-draft workflow:

1. **Pick something you need to write** — an email, a report section, a blog post, anything
2. **Record yourself** talking about it for 3-5 minutes (phone voice memo is fine)
3. **Transcribe it** (use any method you prefer)
4. **Delegate the transformation:**
   > "Here's a rough voice transcription of my thoughts. Turn this into a clear, well-structured [type of writing]. Keep my voice and examples. Target length: [X words]. Save to ~/Documents/Drafts/"
5. **Edit the result** — What needs your human touch? What did Claude nail?

**Success looks like:**
- You bypassed blank page syndrome
- The draft contains your authentic ideas and examples
- You spent more time thinking than typing
- The final piece sounds like you (after your edits)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Claude is a writing partner, not a replacement.** Your ideas, your voice, your stories — Claude helps shape them, not generate them.

2. **Voice notes beat blank pages.** Record yourself rambling, then let Claude organize. Your thinking, their structure.

3. **Train Claude on your voice.** Feed it examples of your writing. Create a voice profile. Use it for consistency.

4. **Specific editing requests get specific results.** Don't say "make it better." Say exactly what's wrong.

5. **Email is a perfect use case.** Drafts, replies, difficult messages — Claude handles the structure, you add the humanity.
