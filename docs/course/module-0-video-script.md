# Module 0 Video Script

## "The Mental Model Shift"

**Target Length:** 12-15 minutes
**Format:** Screen recording with voiceover (iPhone + screen capture is fine)
**Tone:** Conversational, like explaining to a smart friend

## INTRO (1 min)

**[Screen: Course title slide]**

"Hey, I'm Eddie. I run two businesses - one produces reality TV for networks like TLC, the other builds AI tools for developers.

Neither requires me to write code every day. But Claude Code has become the most important tool in both.

If you've dismissed Claude Code because of its name, you're missing the point entirely. Let me show you what it actually is."

## THE NAME PROBLEM (2 min)

**[Screen: "Claude Code" with X over "Code"]**

"Let's get this out of the way. 'Claude Code' is a terrible name.

When you hear 'Code' you think: developers, programming, syntax, not for me.

Here's what it actually is: Claude running locally on your computer with superpowers.

Think of it as Claude Local. Or Claude Agent. Or Claude with File Access.

The 'Code' part is just how it was built. It doesn't describe what it does for you."

## THE 3 SUPERPOWERS (3 min)

**[Screen: Split screen - web Claude vs Claude Code terminal]**

"Claude Code gives you three things that web Claude can't.

**Number one: File System Access**

**[Demo: Show terminal, run `ls ~/Documents`]**

Web Claude can only see what you paste into the chat. Claude Code can see your entire computer. Every folder. Every document.

Watch this: 'Show me all PDFs in my Documents folder from the last month.'

**[Run the command, show results]**

That took 2 seconds. Doing that manually? Five minutes minimum.

**Number two: Long-Running Sessions**

Web Claude forgets everything when you close the tab. Claude Code remembers. It can work for hours. It maintains context.

**Number three: Tool Installation**

Web Claude is sandboxed. Claude Code can install external tools. Web search. Browser automation. Database connections.

I use Perplexity and Firecrawl integrations to search the web, pull backgrounds, scout locations. Claude processes everything and surfaces what matters."

## THE MENTAL MODEL SHIFT (3 min)

**[Screen: Side by side comparison]**

"Here's the shift that changes everything.

Old mental model: 'Help me with X'
New mental model: 'Do X'

Old: 'What should I write?'
New: 'Write it and save to this folder'

Old: 'How do I organize these?'
New: 'Organize these'

The shift is from assistance to delegation.

**[Screen: Example prompt]**

Let me show you the difference.

Old way: 'Help me write interview questions for a podcast guest'

Claude gives you suggestions. You copy them. You edit them. You format them. You save them.

New way: 'Here's the guest's bio and our previous episode topics. Generate 15 interview questions that build on what we've covered. Save them to Podcast Prep slash Guest Name dot md.'

Claude does all of it. You review the output.

One gives you suggestions. The other gives you deliverables."

## LIVE DEMO: YOUR FIRST DELEGATION (4 min)

**[Screen: Terminal - full screen]**

"Let's prove this works. I'm going to walk you through your first delegation.

**[Type commands as you explain]**

Step one: Open Terminal. On Mac that's Command Space, type Terminal.

Step two: Install Claude Code. Copy this command:

`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`

**[If already installed, show the output]**

Step three: Start Claude Code. Just type 'claude'.

**[Show the prompt]**

That's it. You're in.

Now let's do something real. I'm going to navigate to my Downloads folder.

`cd ~/Downloads`

And here's my first delegation:

'Show me what's in this folder. Group files by type. Tell me which ones are duplicates. Create a summary of what's taking up the most space.'

**[Let it run, show the output]**

Watch what happens. It's scanning... analyzing... and here's the summary.

**[Point out key parts of the output]**

I didn't write any code. I just asked for what I wanted.

This would have taken me 20-30 minutes manually. Opening Finder, sorting, checking for duplicates, adding up sizes. Claude Code did it in seconds."

## THE MOMENT IT CLICKED FOR ME (2 min)

**[Screen: Back to talking head or title slide]**

"Let me tell you when this clicked for me.

I had an iCloud folder with over 10 years of files. Screenshots, voice memos, PDFs, random documents. A digital junk drawer I'd been meaning to clean up since 2015.

One afternoon, I pointed Claude Code at it.

'Go through this folder. Build me an intake system. Categorize everything.'

What happened next shifted how I think about AI.

Claude didn't just sort files into folders. It understood them. It read documents, parsed images, identified patterns. It built a categorization system based on what the files actually contained.

Hours later, I had structure. Contracts in one place. Creative assets in another. Research organized by topic. Voice memos transcribed and tagged.

But here's what hit me: none of it was junk. Every file I'd saved over a decade, I'd saved for a reason. It was treasure. I just needed someone to help me see it.

That's when I realized: Claude Code isn't a coding tool. It's a thinking partner that happens to run on your computer."

## WHAT'S NEXT (1 min)

**[Screen: Course curriculum]**

"This is Module 0. A taste of what's possible.

The full course goes deeper:

Module 1: Your First Delegation - low-risk, high-value file tasks
Module 2: Working With Your Files - document processing, invoices
Module 3: The Writer's Workflow - voice notes to polished drafts
Module 4: Research and Analysis - competitive research, synthesis
Module 5: Personal Operations System - automation, recurring workflows
Module 6: Power User Patterns - MCP servers, advanced techniques

Each module builds on the last. By the end, you'll have a personal operating system.

**[Screen: Waitlist link]**

Join the waitlist at id8labs.app/courses/claude-for-knowledge-workers.

You'll get early access plus this module free when we launch.

Stop asking. Start delegating.

See you inside."

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**Recording Setup:**
- Screen recording: QuickTime or OBS
- Voiceover: Can record separately and sync
- Terminal: Use a clean, readable font size (14-16pt)
- Pace: Slightly slower than natural, leave room for viewers to follow

**Key Moments to Nail:**
1. The "delegation vs assistance" comparison
2. The live demo showing real output
3. The iCloud junk drawer story (this is your signature moment)

**B-Roll Options (optional):**
- Close-up of terminal
- Split screen comparisons
- Text overlays for key phrases

**Music:**
- Light, upbeat background during intro/outro
- Silent during demo sections

## THUMBNAIL IDEAS

1. "Claude Code" with the "Code" crossed out, replaced with "Agent"
2. Split screen: frustrated person copy-pasting vs calm person with deliverables
3. Terminal screen with "Organizing your files..." text
4. "Stop Asking. Start Delegating." text on dark background
