## Introduction

Welcome back. If you completed Module 0, you've already installed Claude Code and cleaned up your Downloads folder. You felt that first "holy shit" moment when Claude did in seconds what would've taken you 20 minutes.

Now we're going to build on that. This module gives you a menu of quick wins—different delegation targets to practice with—and deepens your understanding of why the delegation formula works. By the end, you'll have the confidence to delegate anything.

---

## The Confidence Problem

Here's what happens to most people after Module 0: they run one delegation, feel great, and then... freeze. They don't know what else to try. They wait for another "perfect" use case. Days pass. Claude Code sits unused. The momentum dies.

Eddie's rule for learning Claude Code: **Your first 10 delegations should be things you could undo in 30 seconds.**

Why? Because fear kills learning. When you're scared of breaking something, you don't experiment. When you don't experiment, you don't discover what's possible.

Eddie's own learning curve:

> "After my Downloads cleanup, I froze for a week. I kept thinking 'I need a big project.' Wrong. I needed small wins. So I made a list: Desktop cleanup. Old screenshots. Duplicate photos. Naming my voice memos. None of these mattered if they went wrong. All of them gave me practice. By delegation #10, I wasn't thinking about HOW to delegate anymore. I was thinking about WHAT to delegate."

The goal of this module is reps—building the muscle memory of delegation.

## The Delegation Formula: Going Deeper

In Module 0, you learned the formula: **Context + Outcome + Location**. But knowing a formula and feeling it are different. Let's make it intuitive.

The formula exists because Claude needs three things to work autonomously:

**Context:** What can Claude see? What does it need to know?
- "Look at my Desktop"
- "Here's my client list in this folder"
- "These are screenshots from last month"

**Outcome:** What does "done" look like? Be specific.
- NOT: "Organize these"
- YES: "Group by file type into subfolders"
- EVEN BETTER: "Group by file type. Delete anything older than 90 days. Tell me what you removed."

**Location:** Where should the result go?
- "Save to ~/Documents/Organized/"
- "Create a summary in cleanup-log.txt on my Desktop"
- "Move duplicates to ~/Trash/Review/"

**The common mistake:** People skip Location. They say "organize my files" and Claude asks "where should I put them?" Now you're having a conversation instead of delegating work.

### Bad vs Good Delegations

| Bad Delegation | Good Delegation |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "Help me with my photos" | "Look at ~/Pictures/2024. Find all screenshots. Move them to ~/Pictures/Screenshots. Delete any smaller than 50KB." |
| "Clean up my Desktop" | "Look at my Desktop. Group files by type (PDFs, Images, Documents, Other). Create those folders and move files. List anything you couldn't categorize." |
| "Find duplicates" | "Scan ~/Documents for duplicate files. Group them by content, not name. Create ~/Documents/Duplicates-Review/ and move all but one copy of each there. Tell me how much space I'd save." |

The formula becomes automatic after 5-10 delegations. You'll stop thinking about it consciously—like how you don't think about the grammar of a sentence you're speaking.

## The Quick Wins Menu

Here's your practice menu. Ten delegations you can run this week. None will break anything. All will teach you something. Pick the ones that spark a "oh, I've been meaning to do that" feeling.

### Quick Win #1: Desktop Triage

**The delegation:**
> "Look at my Desktop. Count how many files are there. Group them by type. Tell me what's taking up the most space. Don't move anything yet—just give me the report."

**Why it's good:** Low risk (just a report), immediate insight, sets up a follow-up delegation.

### Quick Win #2: Screenshot Archaeology

**The delegation:**
> "Find all screenshots on my computer (they usually start with 'Screenshot' or 'Screen Shot'). Tell me how many there are, where they're scattered, and how much space they use. Group the results by year."

**Why it's good:** Screenshots multiply invisibly. This reveals the problem before you solve it.

### Quick Win #3: The Duplicate Hunt

**The delegation:**
> "Look at ~/Downloads. Find files that appear to be duplicates (same name with (1), (2), etc. or identical content). Don't delete anything—just list them and tell me how much space they're using."

**Why it's good:** Safe (no deletion), reveals clutter, you decide what to do next.

### Quick Win #4: The Rename Batch

**The delegation:**
> "Look at the files in ~/Documents/[SomeProject]. Rename them all to follow this pattern: YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-name. Use the file's creation date for the date."

**Why it's good:** Teaches batch operations, makes files searchable, reversible if you don't like the names.

### Quick Win #5: The Space Audit

**The delegation:**
> "Analyze my Documents folder. Show me the 10 largest files and the 5 largest subfolders. Format as a table with sizes in MB or GB."

**Why it's good:** Pure information, no changes, reveals forgotten bloat.

### Quick Win #6: The Old File Report

**The delegation:**
> "Find all files in ~/Documents that haven't been modified in over 2 years. Group them by type. Tell me the total size."

**Why it's good:** Discovers digital archaeology, no action required, informs future cleanup.

### Quick Win #7: The Extension Sort

**The delegation:**
> "Look at ~/Downloads. Tell me how many files of each type are there (.pdf, .jpg, .png, .dmg, .zip, etc.). Format as a table sorted by count."

**Why it's good:** Quick snapshot, reveals patterns (probably too many .dmg installers).

### Quick Win #8: The Project Inventory

**The delegation:**
> "List all folders in ~/Documents. For each one, tell me: when it was last modified, how many files it contains, and total size. Format as a table sorted by last modified date."

**Why it's good:** Bird's-eye view of your work, reveals abandoned projects.

### Quick Win #9: The Empty Folder Sweep

**The delegation:**
> "Find all empty folders in ~/Documents. List them. Ask me before deleting any."

**Why it's good:** Low stakes, satisfying cleanup, teaches the "ask before acting" pattern.

### Quick Win #10: The Temporary File Purge Report

**The delegation:**
> "Find all files in ~/Downloads that look temporary—.tmp files, .dmg installers, .zip files that have already been extracted (folder with same name exists). Don't delete—just list and calculate total size."

**Why it's good:** Reveals recoverable space, you control deletion.

### Eddie's Recommendation

> "Start with #1 (Desktop Triage) or #5 (Space Audit). They're pure information—Claude looks and reports, nothing moves. You get a win without any risk. Then try #4 (Rename Batch) on a folder you don't care about. That teaches you batch operations. By your third delegation, you'll be ready to let Claude actually move files."

## When Things Go Wrong

Claude will ask you questions sometimes. It will ask permission before doing things. Sometimes it misunderstands. This isn't failure—it's collaboration. But you need to know how to handle it.

### Situation 1: Claude asks for clarification

**Claude says:** "I found 47 files. Should I organize them by date created or date modified?"

**What to do:** Answer specifically. "Use date modified. Format as YYYY-MM-DD."

**Why it happens:** Your delegation was slightly ambiguous. That's fine—now you know to specify next time.

### Situation 2: Claude asks for permission

**Claude says:** "I'm about to move 200 files. Should I proceed?"

**What to do:** This is good! Claude is being careful. Say "yes" or "show me the list first."

**Why it happens:** Claude Code has safety rails. Large operations trigger confirmation. This protects you.

### Situation 3: Claude does something unexpected

You asked for organization, but the folder structure isn't what you imagined.

**What to do:** Don't panic. Say "Undo that" or "Move everything back." Then re-delegate with more specific outcome description.

**Why it happens:** "Organize" means different things. Be more specific: "Create folders by file type" vs "Create folders by date" vs "Create folders by project name."

### Situation 4: Claude says it can't do something

**Claude says:** "I don't have permission to access that folder."

**What to do:** This usually means you're trying to access protected system files, or you need to grant Claude access in System Preferences (Mac) or Security settings (Windows).

**Why it happens:** Your operating system protects certain folders. This is good. Work within your user folders (Documents, Downloads, Desktop).

### Eddie's Troubleshooting Story

> "Early on, I asked Claude to 'organize my music.' It created folders by artist—not what I wanted. I wanted folders by genre. My mistake: I said 'organize' without specifying HOW. I could have panicked. Instead, I said 'move everything back to the original folder' and re-delegated: 'Organize music by genre. Create a folder for each genre. If genre isn't in the metadata, put it in Unknown.'
>
> The redo took 10 seconds. No harm done. That taught me: specific outcomes, not vague verbs."

## The Delegation Mindset

Here's what separates people who use Claude Code once from people who use it daily: mindset. It's not about the tool—it's about how you see your own work.

The shift happens when you stop asking "Can Claude do this?" and start asking "Why am I doing this myself?"

**Old mindset triggers:**
- "I need to organize my files" → You open Finder and start clicking
- "I should clean up my Desktop" → You drag things manually
- "I wonder what's taking up space" → You right-click and check sizes one by one

**New mindset triggers:**
- "I need to organize my files" → "What's my Context + Outcome + Location?"
- "I should clean up my Desktop" → "Let me delegate that"
- "I wonder what's taking up space" → "Claude can tell me in 10 seconds"

The goal isn't to use Claude for everything. The goal is to PAUSE before manual work and ask: "Is this delegation-able?"

Eddie's daily practice:

> "I keep a mental tally. Every time I catch myself doing repetitive file work manually, I stop and delegate instead. At first, it was slower—I had to think through the formula. Now it's faster. And more importantly, I'm not tired at the end of organizing things. Claude did the work. I did the thinking."

This mindset extends far beyond files. In Module 3, you'll apply it to writing. In Module 4, research. In Module 5, you'll build recurring workflows that run without you. But it all starts here: building the reflex to delegate.

## Your Challenge: The Confidence Builder

This week, run **three delegations** from the Quick Wins Menu. Choose based on what feels useful, not what feels impressive.

**Recommended path:**
1. **Start with a report** (Quick Win #1, #5, or #6)—Claude looks and tells you what it sees
2. **Then try a batch operation** (Quick Win #4)—Claude makes changes you could reverse
3. **Finish with a hunt** (Quick Win #2 or #3)—Claude searches across your system

**Success looks like:**
- You ran three delegations without getting stuck
- You handled at least one clarification question from Claude
- You feel less hesitant about what to try next

**Why this matters:** Confidence compounds. Three small wins this week means you'll try bigger things next week. By Module 3, you'll be delegating creative work. But only if you build the foundation now.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Volume beats perfection.** Your first 10 delegations should be low-stakes practice.

2. **The formula is Context + Outcome + Location.** Skip any piece and you'll end up in a conversation instead of a delegation.

3. **"Organize" is not an outcome.** Specify HOW: by date, by type, by project, by size.

4. **Mistakes are cheap.** "Undo that" and re-delegate. Nothing is permanent.

5. **Build the reflex.** Before manual work, ask: "Is this delegation-able?"

## What's Next

You've built confidence with quick wins. Now let's do real work.

In **Module 2: Working With Your Files**, we'll process documents at scale—summarizing 50 PDFs, extracting data from contracts, organizing a year of invoices for tax time. This is where Claude Code stops being a novelty and starts saving you serious hours.

## Quick Reference

### The Delegation Formula

```
CONTEXT: What Claude can see or needs to know
  → "Look at [folder]"
  → "These are [type of files]"

OUTCOME: What "done" looks like (be specific!)
  → NOT: "Organize these"
  → YES: "Group by [criterion]. Create folders. Move files."

LOCATION: Where the result goes
  → "Save to [path]"
  → "Create report in [file]"
```

### Quick Wins At a Glance

| # | Name | Risk Level |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | Desktop Triage | None (report) |
| 2 | Screenshot Archaeology | None (report) |
| 3 | Duplicate Hunt | None (report) |
| 4 | Rename Batch | Low (reversible) |
| 5 | Space Audit | None (report) |

| "Should I [A] or [B]?" | Pick one specifically |
| "Proceed with [big action]?" | Yes, or ask for list first |
| "I don't have permission" | Check system settings |
| [Unexpected result] | "Undo" → re-delegate clearly |
