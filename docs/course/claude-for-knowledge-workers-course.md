# Claude Code for Knowledge Workers

## Course: From Chatbot to Operating System

**Tagline:** Stop asking questions. Start delegating tasks.

---

## The Opportunity

Lenny Rachitsky's newsletter (500K+ subscribers) just published "50 ways non-technical people are using Claude Code." The comments exploded. The market is ready.

**What they're discovering:**
- Claude Code isn't about code - it's Claude running locally with superpowers
- It can navigate your filesystem, run longer sessions, handle huge files
- Think "Claude Agent" or "Claude Local" - not "Claude Code"

**What's missing:**
- Every tutorial assumes developers
- No structured path for writers, researchers, analysts, operators
- No course that teaches the mental model shift: assistance → delegation

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Knowledge workers who use AI daily but hit the ceiling of chat interfaces

- Writers (Substack, freelance, content)
- Researchers (market research, competitive intel, academics)
- Operators (project managers, executive assistants, founders)
- Analysts (financial, product, business)

**Profile:**
- Uses ChatGPT/Claude web daily
- Frustrated by: context limits, session resets, copy-paste workflows
- Technical enough to use terminal (with guidance)
- Values: time savings, process automation, working smarter

**Not for:**
- Developers (they have plenty of resources)
- Complete beginners who've never used AI
- People who want to build software
