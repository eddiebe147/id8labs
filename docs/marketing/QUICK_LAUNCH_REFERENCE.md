# Quick Launch Reference - Copy/Paste Ready

## Day 1 Launch - Copy These Exactly

### LinkedIn Post (9 AM)
**Use this version:**

```
I run reality TV production for 90 Day Fiancé and Teen Mom.

I also build AI tools.

Here's what both taught me: Most people are treating Claude like a better Google. They're asking it questions when they should be delegating work.

That's the shift that changes everything.

We just launched a 6-module course on treating Claude like an operating system, not a chatbot. For writers, researchers, operators, producers - people who work with information, not code.

The mental model shift? It's free. Module 0, no credit card.

The full course? Normally $197, but $99 for founders who are early.

I'm not teaching you to code. I'm teaching you to delegate at scale.

What are you still doing manually that you could delegate tomorrow?

### X/Twitter Thread (12 PM)
**Tweet 1:**
```
I produce reality TV and build AI tools.

Both taught me the same lesson about Claude:

You're using it wrong. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Most people treat Claude like a smart chatbot.

Ask question → Get answer → Copy/paste → Done.

That's leaving 90% of its capability on the table.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The unlock: Claude isn't a chatbot. It's an operating system.

Stop asking questions.
Start delegating work.

"Organize my 500 downloads" beats "How do I organize files?" every single time.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
We just launched a 6-module course on this exact shift.

For knowledge workers who don't code:
→ Writers
→ Researchers
→ Operators
→ Producers

Module 0 is FREE (no card required)
Full course: $99 (normally $197)
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
What you'll learn:

Module 0: Mental model shift (FREE)
Modules 1-2: File processing at scale
Modules 3-4: Writing + research automation
Module 5: Custom workflows

30-day tasks → 30-minute delegations
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
Real example from Module 0:

"Here are 47 voice memos. Turn them into a content calendar. Find the 3 best ideas. Write outlines for each. Save to Google Drive."

One prompt. Done in 5 minutes.

That used to take me 3 hours.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
The full course is $197.

For early adopters: $99 (save $98)

Start with the free module, decide later:

No code required.
Just a different way of thinking.

Most people treat Claude like Google. They're missing the whole point.

Claude isn't a chatbot. It's a delegation layer.

I produce reality TV (90 Day Fiancé, Teen Mom) and build AI products. Both require delegating complex work.

This course teaches you the mental shift from asking questions to handing off work.

Module 0 is completely free. No credit card. Just the shift.

Full course: $99 (normally $197) - link in bio

## Common Reply Templates

**"Is this for non-developers?"**
```
100%. I produce reality TV and I use this daily.

The whole point is you DON'T need to code.

Module 0 shows you the mental shift - it's free, give it a shot: [link]
```

**"What makes this different from YouTube?"**
```
Great question. YouTube shows you prompts.

This course teaches you a framework for thinking about delegation.

Prompts expire. Frameworks scale.

Try Module 0 (free) and you'll see the difference: [link]
```

**"Is $99 worth it?"**
```
Module 0 is free - try it first.

If you save even 2 hours a week, the course pays for itself in a month.

Most people save way more than that.
