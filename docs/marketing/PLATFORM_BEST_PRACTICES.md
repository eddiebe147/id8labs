# Platform Best Practices - Advanced Tactics

## LinkedIn - The Authority Engine

### Algorithm Secrets (2025)
**What LinkedIn prioritizes:**
1. Dwell time (long reads win)
2. Comments over reactions
3. First 60 minutes of engagement
4. Native content (no external links in main post)
5. Personal stories over corporate speak

### Pro Tips:

**Posting Time Sweet Spots:**
- Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM (decision-makers checking feed)
- Avoid weekends (B2B audience offline)
- Don't post Monday before 9 AM (people catching up on weekends)

**Formatting Hacks:**
- Short sentences = higher readability
- Line breaks every 2-3 sentences
- Use numbers and bullet points
- Open with a personal story or contrarian take
- End with a question (drives comments)

**Comment Strategy:**
- Reply within 15 minutes of first comment (algorithm boost)
- Tag people in comments to expand reach
- Ask follow-up questions in replies (drives conversation depth)
- Never reply with just "Thanks" - add value

**What Kills Reach:**
- External links in main post (put in first comment instead)
- Too many hashtags (3-5 max)
- Generic corporate language
- Posting same content across platforms (LinkedIn detects cross-posting)

**Advanced Tactic - The Comment Seed:**
Before posting, DM 3-5 engaged followers: "Hey, posting something about [topic] in 5 min - would love your take if you see it"

This creates early engagement signal that boosts algorithmic distribution.

## X/Twitter - The Viral Machine

### Algorithm Secrets (2025)
**Ranking weights:**
- Quotes: 5x
- Bookmarks: 4x
- Replies: 3x
- Retweets: 2x
- Likes: 1x

**Penalties:**
- External link in main tweet: -100 (use reply instead)
- Excessive hashtags: -30 each beyond 2
- Duplicate content: -50
- "Filtered words" (free, giveaway, scam): shadowban risk

### Pro Tips:

**Character Count Strategy:**
- Sweet spot: 71-100 characters (engagement maximizer)
- Threads: Make each tweet work standalone
- First tweet = hook only (no context needed)

**Media Boost:**
- Original image/video: +2x engagement
- Quote graphics perform well
- Screenshots of text underperform (accessibility issues)
- Alt text on images = better reach

**Thread Construction:**
- Hook tweet under 100 chars
- Tease the thread topic
- Keep it under 10 tweets (attention span limit)
- End with clear CTA
- Link only in final tweet

**Reply Guy Strategy:**
- Reply to relevant tweets in your niche within 1 hour of posting
- Add value, don't just say "Great point"
- Your reply can get more views than original tweet
- Tag relevant accounts to start conversations

**What Kills Reach:**
- Links in main tweet (algorithm suppresses)
- Asking for likes/RTs directly
- Tweeting same content repeatedly
- Using banned/filtered words

**Advanced Tactic - The Bookmark Trap:**
Create "save this" content:
- Lists of resources
- Step-by-step guides
- Before/after comparisons
- Templates and frameworks

Bookmarks signal high value to algorithm.

## Instagram - The Visual Story Machine

### Algorithm Secrets (2025)
**What Instagram prioritizes:**
1. Save rate (highest weight)
2. Share to DMs
3. Completion rate (videos)
4. Time spent on post
5. Comments (but only if genuine)

### Pro Tips:

**Feed Post Strategy:**
- Carousel posts: 3x engagement vs single image
- First slide = scroll stopper
- Use text overlay on images (adds context)
- Caption length: 150-300 words optimal
- Hook in first line (before "...more")

**Reel Optimization:**
- First 3 seconds = hook or scroll
- 15-30 second sweet spot
- Trending audio = discovery boost
- Text overlays for silent viewing
- Post 7-9 PM local time

**Stories Strategy:**
- Post 3-7 stories per day
- Use interactive stickers (polls, questions, quizzes)
- Link stickers drive traffic
- Behind-the-scenes content builds connection
- Reshare user content to stories (builds community)

**Caption Framework:**
```
[Hook line - make them stop scrolling]

[2-3 short paragraphs with line breaks]

[Value delivery or story]

[Call to action or question]

[Hashtags at very end, 3-5 max]
```

**What Kills Reach:**
- External links in caption (use link in bio or stories)
- Hashtag stuffing (30 hashtags = spam signal now)
- Posting and ghosting (no engagement)
- Using banned hashtags
- Low-quality or pixelated images

**Advanced Tactic - The Save Magnet:**
Create posts people want to reference later:
- Infographics
- Tutorial screenshots
- Before/after transformations
- Quote graphics
- Resource lists

When someone saves your post, Instagram shows it to more people.

## TikTok - The Discovery Engine

### Algorithm Secrets (2025)
**What TikTok prioritizes:**
1. Completion rate (king metric)
2. Rewatch signals
3. Comments and shares
4. Trending sounds
5. Watch time

### Pro Tips:

**Hook Science:**
- First 1 second decides scroll or watch
- Pattern interrupts work best
- Questions create open loops
- Contrarian takes hook attention

**Content Structure:**
- 7-21 seconds = highest completion rate
- Keep it under 60 seconds
- Loop the video (end connects to beginning)
- Use trending sounds (but make sense contextually)

**Text Overlay Strategy:**
- Add captions (many watch on mute)
- Use bold text for emphasis
- Reveal information progressively
- Make it scannable

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- 3-5 targeted hashtags
- Mix of broad and niche
- One trending, rest specific
- Avoid banned hashtags

**What Kills Reach:**
- Low-quality video (shaky, dark, blurry)
- Watermarks from other platforms
- Asking for follows/likes directly
- Copyright music violations
- Reposting others' content

**Advanced Tactic - The Hook Matrix:**
Test different hooks on same content:
- "Stop scrolling if..."
- "POV: You just learned..."
- "Watch me [action]..."
- "Most people don't know..."

Same video, different hooks = different performance.

## Cross-Platform Strategy

### Content Repurposing Ladder
**Create once, distribute everywhere:**

1. **Start with long-form value** (LinkedIn post or YouTube video)
2. **Extract short clips** for TikTok/Instagram Reels
3. **Pull quotes** for X/Twitter
4. **Behind-the-scenes** to Instagram Stories
5. **Key insights** to LinkedIn carousel

### Platform-Specific Adaptations
**Same core message, different packaging:**

| Platform | Format | Tone | Length |
|----------|--------|------|--------|
| LinkedIn | Professional story | Authority | 150-300 words |
| X/Twitter | Hot take thread | Conversational | 7 tweets max |
| Instagram | Visual narrative | Relatable | 15-30 sec video |
| TikTok | Quick demo | Casual | 15 sec optimal |

### Timing Coordination
**Don't cannibalize your own reach:**

- LinkedIn: 9 AM
- X/Twitter: 12 PM (different audience awake)
- Instagram: 7 PM (evening scroll time)
- TikTok: 9 PM (peak discovery hours)

Space posts 3-4 hours apart minimum.

## Engagement Tactics That Actually Work

### The First Hour Protocol
**First 60 minutes determine algorithmic fate:**

1. Post content
2. Immediately share to stories (Instagram) or pin (X/Twitter)
3. Set 15-minute timer
4. Reply to every comment within first hour
5. Like thoughtful comments
6. Ask follow-up questions in replies
7. Tag relevant people (sparingly)

### The 80/20 Engagement Rule
**80% of your reach comes from 20% of your audience:**

- Identify your "super engagers" (people who always comment)
- Reply to them first
- Engage with their content regularly
- DM them occasionally (not every time)
- Thank them publicly when appropriate

### Comment Quality Over Quantity
**One great comment beats 10 "thanks":**

Good reply:
```
Great point about [specific thing they said].

I'd add [your insight] because [reasoning].

Have you tried [relevant suggestion]?
```

Bad reply:
```
Thanks for the comment!
```

### The Conversation Starter Framework
**End posts with questions that can't be answered with yes/no:**

Bad: "Do you use Claude?"
Good: "What tasks are you still doing manually?"

Bad: "Is this helpful?"
Good: "Which of these surprised you most?"

## Content Batching System

### Weekly Production Schedule

### Content Bank Strategy
**Always have 7 days of backup content:**

Keep a folder with:
- 5 evergreen posts (timeless value)
- 10 quote graphics
- 3 demo videos
- 7 thread drafts

Use when:
- Too busy to create
- Current events require pause

## Analytics That Matter

### Vanity Metrics (Ignore These)
- Total follower count
- Post likes
- Impressions alone
- Profile views

### Action Metrics (Optimize For These)
- Click-through rate to course
- Free module signups
- Paid conversions
- Save rate (Instagram)
- Bookmark rate (X/Twitter)
- Comment quality (LinkedIn)

### Weekly Review Questions
1. Which post drove the most signups?
2. What time performed best?
3. Which platform converted highest?
4. What content got saved/bookmarked most?
5. Where did people drop off?

**Optimize for dollars, not dopamine.**
